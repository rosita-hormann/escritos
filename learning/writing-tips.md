## Things to do to write

- Study plot structure
- learn about personality types
- write everyday, even if it's just 5 minutes a day. Get into the habit
- Have critique partners
- submit your work even if you think you'll get rejected


## Best plot devices

- Unannounced visit --> forces another character to react. Situation can be malicious or civil. Creates instant suspense. Spices up a slow section
- Discovering a dead body --> character reacts to the gravity of the discovery --> stakes, conflict, questions
otros que me dio lata ver xD
